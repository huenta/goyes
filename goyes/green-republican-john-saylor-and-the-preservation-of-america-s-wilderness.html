          <p class="description" itemprop="description">"Smith's book, the only in-depth study of Saylor, fills a noticeable gap in the histriography of the modern environmental movement. The breadth of Smith's research on Saylor is impressive."<i>--Western Historical Quarterly</i><br/><br/>He was ahead of his time George Alderson This biography digs deep into the early environmental campaigns between 1954 and 1973, when John P. Saylor (Republican of Pennsylvania) was a bold, unquenchable advocate for the environment in the United States Congress. He was out front on all the big ones: Dinosaur National Monument, the Wilderness Act, the Grand Canyon Dams, the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, Redwoods National Park, Alaska national parks. I first met Mr. Saylor in 1965 when I was a beginning volunteer activist, playing a minor role in the campaign to defeat two proposed Grand Canyon dams. The author uses archival sources to take us behind . Mr. Conservation Congressman doomsdayer520 In an era when conservative Republicans display outright hostility to environmentalism, and even Democrats at the national level are getting very little real environmental work done, it is surprising and heartening to learn about the great conservationist achievements and leadership of Republican congressman John Saylor. This generally straight-arrow Republican served a Western Pennsylvania district from 1949 to 1973 and had an immense impact on environmental protection across America. Saylor had a fierce and sincere lifetime love of the outdoors, and advanced a currently rare view of the natural environme. Ahead of his time Outstanding biography of the preemminent conservationist of the 20th century. John P. Saylor was ahead of his time in his successful fight to preserve America's national parks, wilderness and wild rivers. He was a statesman and a great American, not just because he was my Dad.<br/><br/>Environmental leaders dubbed him &ldquo;St. But he also fervently supported legislation to purify the air and water and redeem stripped lands.Considered both a maverick and a pioneer, John Saylor won respect on both sides of the aisle because he was direct, hardworking, and passionate about conservation at a time when the cause was not popular. Because Saylor represented a coal-mining district, he doggedly promoted the use of coal, instead of atomic or hydropower, to generate electricity, and repeatedly won the support of his constituents over thirteen terms between 1949 and 1973.
