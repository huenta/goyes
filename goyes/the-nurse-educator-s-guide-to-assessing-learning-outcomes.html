          <p class="description" itemprop="description">The new edition of this award winning text helps address the increased pressure that the NCLEX and other certification exams are placing on nursing students and faculty. The Nurse Educator&rsquo;s Guide to Assessing Learning Outcomes, 2nd Edition guides classroom educators through the process of developing effective classroom exams and individual test items.<br/><br/>Amazon Customer said Excellent condition. Great price. Excellent condition. Great price .Met my expectations.I would recommendfriends and family and co workers to by from this site.I will use it again.. Great nursing education resource This reference is extraordinarily helpful to any educator who develops multiple choice, or other types of evaluation approaches. I teach those who will be nurse educators, and also new faculty, and have found it to be a great resource for a novice test item writer, as well as helpful to those who are practiced teachers and test writers, but can use a reference for evaluating their tests.. H. Burch said Amazing Resource. This book is a must have for any nursing instructor wanting to improve their skills of writing test questions. It is very easy to follow and even offers many helpful tools in the appendix. I highly recommend this to any nursing instructor.</p>
