          <p class="description" itemprop="description">But when his old friend Harry Lime invites him to Vienna, he jumps at the chance. The victim of an apparently banal street accident, the late Mr. Rollo Martins' usual line is the writing of cheap paperback Westerns under the name of Buck Dexter. Lime, it seems, had been the focus of a criminal investigation, suspected of nothing less than being "the worst racketeer who ever made a dirty living in this city." Martins is determined to clear his friend's name, and begins an investigation of his own. With exactly five pounds in his pocket, he arrives only just in time to make it to his friend's funeral<br/><br/>Many of his novels and short stories have been successfully adapted to the movie screen, including <b>The Third Man</b> (directed by Orson Welles), <b>The End of The Affair</b>, and <b>The Quiet American</b>. <b>Graham Greene</b> (1904-1991) was a prolific novelist, short story writer, travel writer and children's book writer<br/><br/>See the movie - this book was written after the DCMARS See the movie - this book was written after the screenplay - I did not bother to read it..

The Second Version Bill Slocum This book spent two decades on my shelf without my so much as touching it. Now I've read it, and I wish I had read it a long time and several Harry Limes ago in my life.You don't need enemies with friends like Harry Lime. For starters, he effectively strands his old school friend Rollo Martins in postwar Vienna. Lime is occupied with other matters at that moment, like his own funeral, but it stil<br/><br/>From Library Journal Greene's novella, or "entertainment," was written in 1950 as a sort of preliminary draft for a screenplay and was not actually intended to stand alone as a written work. Recommended for all popular collections.?Harriet Edwards, East Meadow P.L., NYCopyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.
