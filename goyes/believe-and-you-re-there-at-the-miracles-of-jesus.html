          <p class="description" itemprop="description">Allison H. Warner gained her early experience living with her family in countries around the world. Johnson a published author and composer, is a featured speaker for youth groups, adult firesides, and women's seminars. About the Author Alice W. . Returning to the United States as a young woman , she began her avocation as an actress and writer, helping develop and performing in such productions as The Farly Family Reunion. A former executive in a worldwide strategy consulting company, and then in a leadership training firm, Alice is now a homemaker living in Idaho, with her husband and their four young children. She and her husband are raising two active boys<br/><br/>After their first adventure, Katie, Matthew, and Peter wonder if more magic awaits them in Grandma's paintings. The answer is clear when they find themselves carried aways to the shores of Galilee. But will the raging sea become calm before Matthew's strength is gone? Will the children get to see one of Jesus' miracles for themselves? And will Abigail ever be able to walk?<br/><br/>Family Time My kids and I read this together each night after family scripture study. They (ages 7,5 and 2) were enamored with the story, often asking me to keep reading as we came to the end of a chapter. The best part is, they have a better understanding of the scriptures and a better knowledge of some of the stories because of this book.. "Teaching My Granddaughter the Scriptures in a Method That is at Her Level." according to Charmae Wiest. I just bought the whole set for my 10 year old granddaughter. I love the way she gets into character as she reads about the baptism of Jesus. It is so cute to listen to her as she acts out the pride of the Pharisees and their haughtiness. I feel she is getting a very vivid picture of the scriptures as she reads and enjoys acting out the characters in the story. A great way to learn and giving her a clear picture and opens up the window of her understanding of . "who doesn't always love to read" according to joi nielson. I got these for my 8 year old daughter, who doesn't always love to read. She devoured this book and is on her way to completely the series! She loves to tell me the facts that she's appreciates the balance of reading a fun story and learning some cool things about the subject matter.<br/><br/>She and her husband are raising two active boys.
