          <p class="description" itemprop="description">A Customer said Go behind the Torn Curtain into Hitchcock's film making. Having been an armchair Hitchcock fan for a few years now, I was eager to read about his creative process to find out just how much he meant to put into making his films. Admittedly, I had read only two other books on Hitchcock before, Donald Spoto's "The Art of Alfred Hitchcock" (after I watch one of Hitch's flicks I crack open that book and read the chapter for said moviegreat analysis)and "Psycho" by Stephen Rebello (great inside stiff - er, stuff - and a cool new cover, no less. Outstanding look at how film-making should be done! A Customer This thick book contains plot treatments for many of his best films, including marked up scripts and Hitchcock's sketches of what he wanted his films to look like. This is one of the best books I've ever found for students of movies.You may feel like you are about to go blind as you read through the handwritten letters and edits to scripts and treatments, but the book really gave me a good idea of who Alfred Hitchcock was and what it means to direct a movie. The book ably shows how. Sorry, Brian from NYC - I have to differ! J B It's obvious HE didn't appreciate the reality of this book. Sure, there are a lot of memos, telegrams, and transcripts of conversations - but it gives an inside look into the life of Hitchcock. Life and character are made up and discovered through little things like this. Sure, I agree that some of the side-by-side script and plot comparisons were a bit dull. But I read this entire book, so it can't have been THAT bad. The writing concerning Shadow of a Doubt is a bit hard to decip<br/><br/>Actual production notes from Hitchcock's masterpieces join detailed interviews with key production personnel, including writers, actors and actresses, and his personal assistant of more than thirty years.Mirroring the director's working methods to give you the actual feel of his process, the book explores the production files of <i>Shadow Of A Doubt, Strangers On A Train, North By Northwest,</i> and others, as well as the legendary lost works: <i>The Mountain Eagle</i> and the unfinished film <i>Kaleidoscope.</i> Highlighted by nearly one hundred photographs and illustrations, chapters focus on finding and constructing the right story (featuring interviews with such renowned screenwriters as Charles Bennett, Samuel Taylor, and Ernest Lehman); envisioning the film (from storyboards to set design); the filming (spotlighting Hitchcock's innovations and trick shots); music; and much more. From <br/><br/>At the other end of the creative journey the book closes with the script for an unproduced <i>Spellbound</i> trailer in which Hitchcock playfully evokes the magic of movies: "That screen up there is like a mind  we here in Hollywood can make anything happen there." <i>Hitchcock's Notebooks</i> is a testament to the powerful vision and sheer hard work that lay behind that magic. He frequently sent script treatments to other writers and filmmakers, asking for their critical comments, and Auiler reproduces several of these correspondences, including Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut's detailed analysis of <i>Kaleidoscope</i>.  There's an enormous amount to take in, but what quickly emerges is a sens</p>
