          <p class="t-side">DESCRIPTION: <p>
          <p class="description" itemprop="description">.  A graduate of Columbia University, Shira Boss has been a fulltime freelance journalist writing mostly on personal finance and business. She has been a regular contributor to Forbes, Good Housekeeping, Christian Science Monitor, Crain's New York Business, and NPR's "Marketplace." She and her husband live in Manhattan<br/><br/>Mark Danaher said Most honest personal finance book out there. First and foremost, i loved the first and second chapters about the author's perception of her neighbors and what the reality turned out to be. This book is hilarious, a page turner and also pretty scary at times as I can relate to the slippery slope of charging more than i need to.It's not your typical 9-steps to riches book, it's much deeper than that. I've read many personal finance books, but never came across one that really deals with the pyschological aspects of things. And that's actually where most of us need help and the book off. Kendra Crook said A surprising page turner. This was a surprising page turner for me, because I NEVER read books like this.I don't even slow down by the personal finance section of Barnes & Noble. I decided to read it because I felt like I was seeing mention of it everywhere - CNN, NPR and USA Today. Figured if it was getting this much press, it was probably worth a try.and I was right.I enjoyed it so much that I bought a copy for my parents, my in-laws and several accountant friends. And they have all enjoyed it.and for different reasons, my parents and in-laws liked the personal s. Fun Read While it's true that there is not a great deal of "new" information in this book-that's largely true of most books on money. There is only so much money information to dispense and there are many, many books on money out there. Green with Envy gives a new and interesting spin on that information. It is also fun and--I'll admit it--a little gossipy. It was particularly interesting to read about the money woes of our members of congress. Many people, myself included, read books on money not so much for information, but for incentive to keep <br/><br/>But how can anyone make realistic comparisons to others when everyone's personal finances are shrouded in secrecy and shame? GREEN WITH ENVY offers a tantalizing mix of hard facts and juicy gossip while exposing the shocking gap between public image and what's really going on behind closed doors. Everyone wants to keep up with the Joneses, regardless of income, occupation, or net worth. Our contentment is based not on the size of our bank account but on how we measure up to those around us. Boss peers into the lives and checkbooks of our neighbors--from a U.S. A silent struggle with our money is raging across America. Congressman to a New York City couple to a suburban family--and gives readers practical steps to improve their financial well-being without touching their bank account.<br/><br/>Even so, Boss's case for candor is valuable. Worse, her soft concluding chapter tacks toward self-help, offering counsel that's surprisingly platitudinous ("The universe will provide"). Boss argues that envy ("the only vice warned against in both the Ten Commandments and the Seven Deadly Sins") can be good for the economy, but our drive to keep up with our neighbors can be unhealthy. <i>(May)</i>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. From Publishers Weekly Freelance journalist Boss performs a real service by putting some of America's financial hangups on trial, charging that "the money taboo"&mdash;our good-manners reluctance to discuss what we earn and spend&mdash;is "destructive nonsense" that leads to debt and despair. In five case studies, she shows the consequences of maintaining appea</p>
