          <p class="description" itemprop="description">Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise book has been released since 2014-01-25. Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise are written by Anders Ericsson, Robert Pool and it has 438 of pages on .<br/><br/>"(Deliberate) practice makes perfect?" according to Ash Jogalekar. Anders Ericsson became famous for his work on what he called "deliberate practice", a set of recipes that could help someone gain expertise in an area. In this readable and well-researched book he expands upon this concept and brings several time-tested and scientifically reviewed ideas to bear on the search for perfection in our lives. Ericsson and his co-author Robert Pool are good storytellers and they pepper their ideas with dozens of case studies and examples from diverse fields like music, sports and medicine.In the first part of the book Ericsson dispels the myth that most "prodigies" or experts achieve what they do. Why some people are amazingly good at what they do&hellip;and why so many others aren&rsquo;t Robert Morris In &ldquo;The Making of an Expert,&rdquo; an article that appeared in the July&ndash;August 2007 issue of Harvard Business Review, K.

"A remarkably practical book on how to get better at anything you do" according to Dan Coughlin. Every once in a great while a book comes out that is so useful and so relevant for such a widely diverse group of people that I want to stand on my rooftop and yell, &ldquo;Read this book now!&rdquo; Fortunately, it&rsquo;s way safer for me to just write about it.Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise by Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool is the book I encourage you to read. Quite simply, it explains in great detail how to continually improve performance in any type of activity. It also explains what it takes to be the best in the world at whatever you do. These explanations are not complicated or theoretical. This b</p>
