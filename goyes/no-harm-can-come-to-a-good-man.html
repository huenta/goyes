          <p class="description" itemprop="description">He has worked as a computer game writer and currently teaches creative writing. The Machine was shortlisted for the 2014 Arthur C Clarke Award. He lives in London.. Previous novels include The Testimony, The Explorer (published by Voyager) and The Machine. James Smythe was born in London in 1980<br/><br/>How far would you go to save your family from an invisible threat? A terrifyingly original thriller from the author of The Machine.ClearVista is used by everyone and can predict everything.It&rsquo;s a daily lifesaver, predicting weather to traffic to who you should befriend.Laurence Walker wants to be the next President of the United States. ClearVista will predict his chances.It will predict whether he's the right man for the job.It will predict that his son can only survive for 102 seconds underwater.It will predict that Laurence's life is about to collapse in the most unimaginable way.<br/><br/>Essential pre-reading for the 2016 election No Harm is the story of Laurence Walker, the front-runner to become the next President of the United States.However, Laurence shouldn't celebrate just yet, as the road between now and the White House is paved with unthinkable tragedy and unknowable challenges. Or maybe not completely unknowable. ClearVista, the ultimate Big Data software, is a prediction software used for everything from search results to stock market forecasting. Laurence and his rivals consult the algorithmic Oracle as part of the campai. Good but slightly flawed I thought this was a good book, but not quite as good as the excellent The Machine The Machine.Smythe does some things very well indeed in this novel. It is set in the near future, and he creates a very convincing picture of the type of predictive technology which might determine a good deal of our lives. He builds the tension very well with the sense of inevitability of Greek tragedy, and he gives a chillingly convincing portrait of how people cannot or will not distinguish between reality and what they s. "What does it mean to be a good man?" according to Glen Mehn. What does it mean to be a good man, and is that something you can predict? This is the question that Smythe asks through this&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know what you call it. Anti-allegory?To read this is to get caught up in a story that fits comfortably inside a litfic longlist: there&rsquo;s a man, with a loving wife and children, not without problems. He&rsquo;s a normal man, a Senator, a good man.Something starts to change. The tone becomes darker. This is subversive genre fiction working its way into your<br/><br/>The sort of story that reminds us why we read, and what we, the people, need&rsquo; Tor. &lsquo;A truly thought-provoking thriller that remains a page-turner right to the end&rsquo; Booklist&lsquo;A writer of bold imagination and verve&rsquo; Lauren Beukes&lsquo;Savage, intimate and inexorable&rsquo; Nick Harkaway&lsquo;Powerful and distinctive&rsquo; Guardian&lsquo;Smythe&rsquo;s storytelling is pacey and addictive; he has a fiendish talent for springing surprises&rsquo; The Times&lsquo;Fully formed, fundamentally affecting, forward-thinking fiction</p>
