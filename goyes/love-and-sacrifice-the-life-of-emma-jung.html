          <p class="description" itemprop="description">Kathleen Llanwarne, English by birth, now lives in Brussels where she has worked as a translator for thirty years. Emma&rsquo;s achievements have so much to teach us.&rdquo;John Cerullo, professor of history, University of New Hampshire at Manchester&ldquo;Imelda Gaudissart has the great merit of having molded the biographical material about Emma Jung-Rauschenbach into an interesting and moving essay. Her interest in the work of C. Little attention has been paid to Emma Jung&rsquo;s role in the history of analytical psychology and in the life of C. G. Imelda Gaudissart has managed to correct this<br/><br/>what life must have been like for Emma married to such a man of tremendous Diane DeArmond I have wondered many times, what life must have been like for Emma married to such a man of tremendous spirit and force. it turns out that she is of equal force only in a far different way. Perhaps it is because she is a woman and has the magnificence of personality to match Carl and also be his CEO. Her life is certainly an inspiration to us women who are seeking a path of eros rather than power. Emma's power is a completely different breed, and I enjoyed learning about her,her accomplishments, and her struggles.. Amazon Customer said Excellent biography. This is a special kind of adventure story, and Emma Jung is a special kind of heroine. The challenges she faced would have crushed many of us &ndash; and they would have crushed Emma too, if she hadn&rsquo;t had the courage to literally rebuild herself, piece by piece, with materials painfully excavated from her own psyche. Love and Sacrifice is the story of that process, and its outcome: the achievement of wholeness, and of a whole new variety of love.Carl Jung provokes, illuminates, enriches. But it is Emma Jung who truly inspires. With this wonderful biography, Imelda Gaudissart has. I love this deeply felt book about the much overlooked deborah I love this deeply felt book about the much overlooked, underappreciated Emma Jung. The author is able to combine biography and imaginative narrative in a way that does not blur the lines between fact and supposition. I took pleasure learning more about Emma's unique personality, her amazing life, and profoundly difficult struggles managing marriage to a brilliant and difficult man while carving out her own individuality, deepening her own soul. I feel Emma's presence each time I pick up the book.</p>
