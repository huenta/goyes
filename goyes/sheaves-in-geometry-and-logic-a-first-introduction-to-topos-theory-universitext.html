          <p class="description" itemprop="description">top notch Clear, to the point, readable. Not too hard, not too easy. Assumes some general familiarity with categories, but not too much. Everything is developed at a hearty clip: plenty of curt examples; avoids tedium by getting to the point. Ideal if you're mature and interested in mathematics in general, and have the time to set your own pace. Might be a bit challenging for inexperienced grad students on a forced march -- or not. Doable.. Excellent Topos theory now has applications in fields such as music theory, quantum gravity, artificial intelligence, and computer science. It has been viewed by some as being excessively abstract and difficult to learn, and this is certainly true if one attempts to learn it from the research literature. The use of this book to learn topos theory certainly puts this view to rest, as the authors have given the readers an introduction to topos theory that is crystal clear and nicely motivated from an historical point of view. Indeed the prologue to the book gives the reader a deep appreciation of the origi. Substantial Philosophical Interest Gary L. Herstein Several folks have already commented on how this volume provides an excellent formal introduction to category theory and topoi. I have nothing to add to those excellent reviews and encourage others to read them. What I wish to do here is comment on a somewhat tangential subject of my own interest, and that is the philosophy of logic.This book makes clear the very significant connections between logic, what I would call "general spatial reasoning," and category theory. For anyone interested in the underlying core and structure of formal reasoning beyond the questionable dogmas of Russell-Frege p<br/><br/>This text presents topos theory as it has developed from the study of sheaves. Beginning with several examples, it explains the underlying ideas of topology and sheaf theory as well as the general theory of elementary toposes and geometric morphisms and their relation to logic.. Sheaves arose in geometry as coefficients for cohomology and as descriptions of the functions appropriate to various kinds of manifolds. Sheaves also appear in logic as carriers for models of set theory<br/><br/>&hellip; authors have a rare gift for conveying an insider&rsquo;s view of the subject from the start. From the reviews:  "A beautifully written book, a long and well motivated book packed with well chosen clearly explained examples. This book is written in the best Mac Lane style, very clear and very well organized. &hellip; it gives very explicit descriptions of many advanced topics--you can learn a great deal from this book that, before it was published, you could only learn by knowing researchers in the field."
