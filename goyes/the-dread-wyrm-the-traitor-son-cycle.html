          <p class="description" itemprop="description">A tournament. </b>. <b>Some are born to power. The court of Alba has been infiltrated by a dangerous faction of warlike knights, led by the greatest knight in the world: Jean de Vrailly -- and the prize he's fighting for isn't royal favor, but the throne of Alba itself<b>This is the third book in the Traitor Son Cycle, following on <i>The Red Knight</i> and <i>The Fell Sword</i>. But the stakes may be higher than he thinks. He's fought on real and magical battlefields alike, and now he's facing one of the greatest challenges yet. And some have the wisdom never to wield it. </b>The Red Knight has stood against soldiers, armies and the might of an empire without flinching. It's a political contest -- one which the Red Knight has the skill to win. Some seize it. A joyous spring event, the flower of the nobility will ride against each other for royal favor and acclaim<br/><br/>A great read I'll start with the bad news, which is, personally, how I prefer it. There are times when miles uses the same words to often in a short span of time and they become repetitious. It's not very often, but still. Other than that one flaw this book is a fantastic read. Full of adventure and excitement, as well as magic and mystery. I started rea. Good book I enjoy the books by Miles Cameron.

The story is compelling and keeps me interested from beginning to end and that's why I keep purchasing the series. Each one keeps me entertained for hours of reading. Don't hesitate to purchase the series. Awesome Dmcgowan This is my second time through this book. What an amazing journey! The attention to detail is incredible, characters are very well written and the plot has layers upon layers of intrigue. And, oh yeah, the action and battle scenes are amazing. This whole series is comparable to or better than anything else out there.<br/><br/>He also writes historical fiction under another name. Miles Cameron is a full time writer who lives in Canada with his family. The Traitor Son Cycle series is his fantasy debut.<br/><br/>"I cannot recommend the Traitor Son Cycle enough amazing."<b><i><i>SF Signal </i>on<i> The Fell Sword</i></i></b>"<i>The Red Knight</i> is an excellent debutwill only get better as the series progressesyou will be won by the intricate story and sophisticated world building."<b><i><i>Fantasy Book Critic </i>on<i> The Red Knight</i></i></b>"Promising historical fantasy debut featuring an expansive cast, an engaging plot, and a detailed eye for combat."<b><i><i>The Ranting Dragon </i>on<i> The Red Knight </i></i></b>"Literate, intelligent and well-thought-outa pleasingly complex and greatly satisfying novel."<b><i><i>SFF World </i>on<i> The Red Knight</i></i></b>"A rousing read."<b><i><i>SF Signal </i>on<i> The Red Knight</i></i></b></p>
