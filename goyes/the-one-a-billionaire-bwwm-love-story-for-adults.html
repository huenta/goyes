          <p class="description" itemprop="description">Too well really, considering Nicole has a boyfriend! But when Nicole&rsquo;s boss lets Max&rsquo;s ad campaign bomb, and Nicole and her boyfriend mutually end thing, things change for her and Max. Suitable for over 18s only due to sex scenes so hot, you'll need your own billionaire to brew something up with.. With a good job on paper, the reality is her boss doesn&rsquo;t think she - a young black woman - is capable of producing any worthwhile ideas. However when she gets assigned grunt-work for a new client, billionaire beer-brewer Max Daniels, she finds herself in a much different predicament than she expected. She and Max hit it off really well. A heartfelt romance by Ellie Etienne of African American Club. Smart and ambitious Nicole Richards is in a rut. Can this newfound relationship thrive business dramas unfolding around them? Or will their relationship end up losing its fizz before it&rsquo;s barely begun? Find out in this sizzling hot, high-stakes romance by respected black female author Ellie Etienne<br/><br/>Good story It was a good story, but the inclusion of the graphic and steamy sex scenes did little to enhance the story. Would recommend, but not for a younger audience.. "Loved it" according to Kindle Customer. I really don't like Anderson. Never thought in a million years that a boss could be so mean. Fred was even worst with his wining. I don't see how Nicole able to be with him for so long. I admired the way Nicole handled her relationship with Fred and her feelings for Max.. A enjoyable read. I enjoyed reading this book. Nicole and Max make a good couple. I was glad when she let go of her ex Fred and moved on with Max. This is a enjoyable read that can be finish in one sitting. I look forward to reading more form the author.</p>
