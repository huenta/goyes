          <p class="description" itemprop="description">The Navarre Bible New Testament commentaries offer extensive explanations of the meaning of the scriptural text and its implications for everyday life. Each volume is self-contained with extensive introductions and notes to Old Testament prophecies. The Navarre Bible commentary is considered by many to be the best Catholic commentary on the Bible available today.. The commentary appears on the same page as the Bible text, which is the Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition. The commentaries draw on a rich variety of sources - Church documents, the writings of the Fathers and Doctors of the Church, and the work of prominent spiritual writers, particularly Saint Josemaria Escriva, who initiated the Navarre Bible project<br/><br/>Navarre is the Best In this volume not only is the Biblical text the RSVCE and the New Vulgate latin text used but you also get two superb articles. Interpretation of Sacred Scripture and its Various Kinds of Meaning and Divine Worship in the Old Testament are two excellant introductory chapters to prepare you for the sublime Epistle to the Hebrews. You also get ,of course ,the Navarre commentary which use sources from Alphonsus Mary Liguori and John Cassian to Vatican II. Without a. "Wonderful" according to Willie. First of all, the books are a powerful series for anyone, from layman to theologian, seeking to enhance their biblical knowledge.I received my used copy in mint condition. I could hardly tell it was used. I did have a little longer wait than anticipated, but I suspect this was due to the Postal Service rather than the vender; who responded to my inquiry promptly.. Rose Lahrman said Per usual, the seperated book of the bible with commentary helps one devote attention to word & meaning of Holy Scripture. The Navarre Bible: The Epistle to the Hebrews allows for easy scripture reading and also provides meaning & content whenever wanted or needed. This commentary series has been a great blessing for me.</p>
