          <p class="description" itemprop="description">Another great episode Another fantastic episode in the continuing sage of Kris Longknife. Action packed and you can read it as a stand-alone novel; but it is even better as the 10th in this series. All characters are full and consistent in their development through this series. This is one series that is part of my permanent library and it receives my 5+ star rating as a series I enjoy re-reading periodically !. Enjoyed it but ??? I enjoyed the book but was also a little disappointed. After eagerly awaiting this latest Kris Longknife adventure, I expected more! It did not seem to be the same style of writing. After each small adventure, you wondered what was happening. The amateur attempts by Alex Longknife appears unrealistic - he is supposed to be very smart.This book leaves you eager to see the next book. However, it seems this story is only a teaser for the next one!. Disappointing L. Alexander As a big (and biased) fan of the Longknife series, I was unfulfilled by this book. It was not up to the author's usual standards, and no part of it left me unable to put it down like the rest have. The plot of this one is convoluted, and surpasses the expected suspension of disbelief for this sci-fi. I dislike the change in chemistry now with Jack and Kris, and the constant inuendo is nauseating; they should have remained longing, but apart.You'll need to read this for continuity, and the ending sets us up for what I dearly hope is a return t<br/><br/>Moscoe, a former civil servant, lives in the Pacific Northwest with his wife Ellen and now writes full-time.  "Mike Shepherd" is a pseudonym for Mike Moscoe. As Mike Shepherd, he has written the five very popular Kris Longknife military science fiction adventures, with more to come! <br/><br/>For her own safety, she&rsquo;s been assigned to a backwater planet where her Fast Patrol Squadron 127 enforces immigration control and smuggler interdiction.But Kris is a Longknife, and nothing can stop her from getting back to the center of things&mdash;not when all hell is breaking loose. Now she&rsquo;s on the run, hunted by both military and civilian authorities&mdash;and since the civilian authorities happen to be her immediate family, Kris soon finds herself homeless, broke, and on trial for her life on an alien world&hellip;. Having used unorthodox methods to save a world&mdash;and every sentient being on it&mdash;Lieutenant Commander Kris Longknife is wanted across the galaxy for crimes against humanity<br/><br/>Praise for the Kris Longknife series:&ldquo;A whopping good read&hellip;fast paced, exciting, nicely detailed, with some innovative touches.&rdquo;<b>&mdash;</b>Elizabeth Moon, Nebula Award&ndash;winning author of <i>Echoes of Betrayal</i>&ldquo;Solid writing, exciting action, and likable characters.&rdquo;&mdash;S. M. Stirling, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Lord of Mountains</i>"I always look forward to installments in the Kris Longknife series because I know I&rsquo;m guaranteed a good time with ple</p>
