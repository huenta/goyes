          <p class="t-side">DESCRIPTION: <p>
          <p class="description" itemprop="description">Sub Sub Rosa Grady Harp DISCLOSED DESIRES is a collection of photographs by Roberto Chiovitti, an Italian photographer/artist who first gained attention for his contributions to Italian magazines such as Vanity Fair, For Men Magazine, SportWeek, Chi, Men's Health and for magazines form Australia, Spain, and other countries. His particular interest in photographing the male model is to ca. "Easy to the eyes" according to N. Chavez. This book is great, I would only wished the size was bigger, the quality of the pics and models really worth a much fair bigger size book, but well I am glad I got it.. A LOOK BACKWARD ! Pat Braun THERE ARE OTHER BOOKS THAT DEAL WITH THE SUBJECT ON A MUCH DEEPER LEVEL SO DISAPPOINTING TO GO BACKWARDS AT A TIME WHEN SO MANY GAYS ARE BREAKING NEW GROUND .<br/><br/>These images are rough and dark, but Chiovitti's works also have a very elaborate approach: The pictures are staged very clever, provoking and unusual. The images in Disclosed Desires tell tales of lust and pain, of dominance and submission. With his focus on the different variations of sexual fetishes he takes up one of the most important trends of the last years to develop his very own language..
