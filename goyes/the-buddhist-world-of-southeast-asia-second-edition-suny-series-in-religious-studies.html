Includes a glossary explaining terms.<br/><br/>Buddhism in Southeast Asia is spiritually and culturally very dynamic, but it also has a political importance that makes it a timely theme for those interested in this part of the world--those not necessarily informed about the history and power of religion in Southeast Asia. "There are many books by notable authorities on the Buddhist world of Southeast Asia. However, these are almost always focused on just one country or culture, while the Swearer book embraces the whole region. "This book surveys many themes. Although rooted in cultural and religious matters, it is also a good historical review of the Theravada tradition. I know of no other text in the English language that sets down such a good descriptive analysis of contemporary Theravada practices." -- Bruce Matthews, Acadia University, Nova Scotia <br/><br/>He is the author or editor of several books, including Becoming the Buddha: The Ritual of Image Consecration in Thailand..

The third is the modern transformation of Buddhism: the changing roles of monks and laity, modern reform movements, the role of women, and Buddhism in the West.Donald K. Expanded and updated, the second edition offers this wide ranging account for readers at the beginning of the twenty-first century.Swearer shows Theravada Buddhism in Southeast Asia to be a dynamic, complex system of thought and practice embedded in the cultures, societies, and histories of Thailand, Myanmar (Burma), Laos, Cambodia, and Sri Lanka.
