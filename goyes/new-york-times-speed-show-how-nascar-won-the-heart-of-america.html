          <p class="description" itemprop="description">Sportswriter Dave Caldwell watches from the stands as a black Chevrolet pulls ahead in the final laps of the Daytona 500. The death of Dale Earnhardt inspired an outpouring of grief, drawing new fans to the sport and driving NASCAR to the top of the sporting industry. From its roots during Prohibition to today's die-hard fans, Dave Caldwell weaves together his firsthand observations as a NASCAR reporter with excerpts from The New York Times archives to give readers an inside look at the spectacle that is America's new favorite pastime.. The car smashes into a wall at 175 miles an hour, killing one of stock car racing's most loved drivers. In an instant, it's over. Daytona Beach, Florida, 2001<br/><br/>Courtesy of Teens Read Too TeensReadToo I admit that I'm a very unique type of NASCAR fan. I love the drivers, love reading about them, checking out the standings, and perusing all the gossip about their personal lives. I don't actually like watching the races. See, how odd is that? Sure, occasionally I'll stumble into a room where the race is on television (thanks to my mom and stepfather, who are NASCAR fanatics), but other than that I won't waste hours sitting down to watch cars drive in endless circles. Bu<br/><br/>The sport's lack of diversity is offset by featuring information on female and minority drivers and the association's efforts to attract a more diverse audience. The book is well documented and enhanced by excellent color photos. Offsets provide more in-depth detail, such as notes on multiple championship winners, biographical info, and historical events. From School Library Journal Grade 6 Up&mdash;This concise history of NASCAR racing and its recent surge in popularity starts with the author's eyewitness account of Dale Earnhardt's fatal crash at the 2001 Daytona 500 and the aftermath of the tragedy, both of which Caldwell covered for the <i>New York Times</i>. Caldwell's text is enjoyably readable, in spite o<br/><br/>. He livesin New Jersey and has two sons.  Dave Caldwell has worked as a correspondent for The New YorkTimes since 2000, covering a variety of sports, including stockcar racing, hockey, baseball, football, and basketball</p>
