          <p class="description" itemprop="description">Addresses the top 100 consultancy & education forum questions, with tips & success factors on Building, Optimizing, Publishing, Marketing & How to Make Money with Blogs.<br/><br/>Worst book I've ever read! Kindle Customer This book is full of grammatical errors, redundancies, and little else. This is my first review because I, generally, agree with other reviewers. I felt so strongly about this book that I had to express it. Don't waste your money!. Don't bother! Save your money. C. Findlay Yes, typos, grammar, redundancy. For instance, every 'chapter' is one page long. There are blank pages where a 'chapter' could have gone. Titles are not centered. Titles have words with hyphens instead of moving the whole damn word to the next line. Some Titles Have Every Single Word Capitalized, And some don't. On one page the paragraphs are spaced, then next they aren't, then its both. So-called chapters included "How to make a Blog", "How to start a Blog", and "How to create a Blog", (excuse me?) Choosing a theme for your blog is scattered throughout, everythi. Susan Bewley said Horrid. I am someone who professionally writes web content and have been researching more information on Wordpress so my husband and I to increase the revenue of our business. Seeing this book,I was willing to give it a chance. Boy, do I wish I kept my money. It looks like the author took SEO articles from Ezine and threw them in a book. Some of the articles themselves look like spun articles. As the other reviewers have stated, there are also countless formatting and grammar issues throughout the book. This would not bother me if the information was at least useful. Buy</p>
