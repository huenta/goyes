          <p class="description" itemprop="description">Don't want to put it down! Margaret Warren I loved Larissa Brown's first book and this one is right there with it. I have not finished it yet  full dis-closer  but could hardly put it down to write this. Her research in the lives of the Vikings of Iceland and her ability to bring the characters to life makes this a thrilling read. I hope this series continues for quite a while.. NJD said Wonderful. Loved it! It was a perfect sequal to Beautiful Wreck.did not want it to end and can't wait for the next book. I really enjoy Historical Fiction and Science Fiction, These books have both and that is why it is very unique. Having the future and the past meet is extremely interesting. Thank you and keep them coming!. A wonderful next chapter in the Beautiful Wreck universe Annalisa D I loved Beautiful Wreck so much that I was a little nervous to venture back to that world, but it was not a disappointment. The first book was all from Jen/Ginn's first person perspective, but this book is different, as we get to follow 3 different people's threads. So Wild A Dream is the story of a woman from the future (Jen's original time) who is recruited to use the tank again to try to replicate Ginn's accidental journey. She meets up with the family we know and love from Beautiful Wreck, initially by encountering Brosa, Heirik's brother, alone on a hill. Brosa would not like to hear me saying this, but I do <br/><br/>But she has no intention of staying in his Viking world. E&eth;na Jonsdottir is on a mission. Brosa Ulfsson is handsome, capable, easygoing &ndash; or he was until tragedy and grief swallowed him. E&eth;na coaxes him from the grave and wakens his forgotten dreams. Touch down in 10th century Iceland, gather what she needs regardless of the consequences, and return to the 22nd century, becoming the world&rsquo;s first time machine test pilot. How far into the wilds of the past will E&eth;na go to save Brosa, when her own dreams hang in the balance? So Wild A Dream is the first part of a two-book story set in the fictional White Woods of 10th century Iceland &ndash; a world first seen in Larissa Brown's bestselling novel Beautiful Wreck.. Falling in love isn&rsquo;t on the checklist. Svana is a young woman set on vengeance. With a curse and plea to the gods, she kindles the flames of an old feud and explodes everyone&rsquo;s plans, driving E&eth;na to a fateful choice<br/><br/>"Exquisite. The kind of book that makes you hold your breath and keep turning pages." -- Laura Stanfill, award winning author of Brave On The Page </p>
