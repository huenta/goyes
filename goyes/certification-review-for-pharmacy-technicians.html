          <p class="description" itemprop="description">Easy read and best math prep for PTCB Certification I'm med student (looking for summer job to help me learn my meds for next year) & had no knowledge of the profession. I studied Noah's book as part of a pharm tech class and got it in 1st week of February 2003 and easily scored a 790 (out of 300-900 scale) on March 30th 2003, without knowing ANY of the meds on the PTCB because I was able to know each and every math question through his book. His formulas are excellent and he teaches alligations which only pharmacists are familiar with but make calculations an absol. "Very Helpful!!!" according to Laura M. Mchenry. This book was extremely helpful. I was very pleased that I bought this book because when I took the test there were some of the exact same questions on the test as there were in the book. All I recommend is that you should take all of the practice tests (all Very Helpful!!! Laura M. Mchenry This book was extremely helpful. I was very pleased that I bought this book because when I took the test there were some of the exact same questions on the test as there were in the book. All I recommend is that you should take all of the practice tests (all 4) and review the questions that you missed. I did this and only studied about a month ahead and I scored about 780 (you have to score 650 to pass), and I only had a little bit of pharmacy experience (volunteered in a pharmacy).

KNOW YOUR CONVERSIONS. Know ever. Helpful study guide! A Customer I have no pharmacy experience and want to obtain a part-time position as a technician to gain experience prior to applying for pharmacy school next year. In TX, certification is required, so I took the exam on Nov. 15, 03. This is the only book that I studied, and I passed w/ a scaled score of 837 (scale is from 300-900; 650 is passing score). As another reviewer stated, this is a great prep for the math questions. I felt confident in each math question I answered on the exam b/c of this book. I highly recommend it<br/><br/>Exam review for those preparing for the PTCB's National Certification Exam.
