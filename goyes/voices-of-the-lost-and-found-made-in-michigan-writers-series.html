          <p class="description" itemprop="description">Joseph Borri said A startlingly original voice creates a dark ride. Reading the stories in Dorene O'Brien's short story collection, Voices of the Lost and Found, is akin to having a carnival worker assure you that there's nothing to worry about, even as he grins menacingly watching the car you're sitting in enter some dark tunnel ahead. I skipped around as I often do in a collection of shorts, and was wrapped up in a blaze of tension right off the bat, immersing myself in Riding the Hubcap, a tale of two . Susan Goodwill said Virtuoso. If you haven't read Dorene O'Brien before, be advised: This is one of those anthologies where you will read one story or maybe just one page of Ms. O'Brien's writing and you will know that twenty years from now, you will remember where you were. She is that good.You will know you are witnessing something special. Another reviewer used the word virtuosity. I couldn't agree more. From the unexpected endings to the diverse voices, from the e. "A Superlative Debut Collection" according to pattinase. Ms. O'Brien's collection is a delight from start to finish. These are dark stories dealing with the underbelly of society told in pristine prose. O'Brien is a wordsmith and a compelling storyteller. I recommend this collection to everyone who reveres the short story.<br/><br/>This adventurous and memorable collection of short fiction will appeal to a diverse audience..  Though the voices change, the tone of the collection is consistently strong and convincing, bringing forth a fresh perspective on both contemporary social issues and modern angst.  The startlingly real speakers of Voices of the Lost and Found are drawn directly from contemporary culture, and together they present a striking portrait of alienation, volatility, diversity, and violence in postmodern America. Told with honesty and intense emotion, the stories allow readers to experience the full weight of each character's particular burden and to understand his or her complex personal motivations firsthand. In eleven first-person stories, a variety of authentic and unexpected voices come to the forefront to confess or retell stories of lost innocence or betrayal-from the urban graffiti artist who plots the downfall of a rival gang, to the middle-aged woman reliving a harrowing childhood abduction, to the young man who remodels his house in a misguided attempt to win back his wife, to the teenager who is lured into a crime spree after trusting a dark and disturbed friend. Here, the lonely and troubled characters face tremendous ob<br/><br/>She has won numerous awards for her fiction, including the Bridport Prize for her short story "#12 Dagwood on Rye," Chicago Tribune's Nelson Algren Award for "Riding the Hubcap," and the New Millennium Writings Fiction Award for "Ovenbirds." In 2004 she was also awarded a creative writing fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. .

In reading her, Nathaniel West comes to mind, and Flannery O'Conner: that flinty unflinchingness before life's inexplicabilities, that defiant laugh in the face of darkness. As numerous awards testify, O'Brien's talent, her sheer virtuosity, has long b</p>
