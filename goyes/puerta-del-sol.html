          <p class="t-side">DESCRIPTION: <p>
          <p class="description" itemprop="description">He is the author of three chapbooks, most recently Tertulia (BOOKlyn). .  Francisco Arag&oacute;n&rsquo;s journal publications include La Calaca Review, Heliotrope, and Terra Incognita. He has also published in the anthology Under the Fifth Sun: Latino Literature from California (Heydey Books). The founding editor and publisher of Momotombo Press, which supports emerging Latino/a writers, he is currently a fellow at the Institute for Latino Studies at the<br/><br/>Taking its title from the central plaza in Madrid, it chronicles an overseas journey both public and private. Francisco Arag&oacute;n extends the map of Latino poetry in this bilingual collection. The work, in essence, inhabits a seldom explored bicultural space; for Arag&oacute;n the author is also Arag&oacute;n the translator, shaping with his own hand Spanish versions of all these poems, thereby embodying the years he shuttled between his native California and his adopted Spain.. Life in the capital&mdash;taking in jazz at a caf&eacute; after dark, navigating the underground landscapes of the Metro to and from work&mdash;is interwoven with the more interior realms of loss in poems that mourn a parent, retrace the steps of a late mentor, or express the collective grief b<br/><br/>That he does not allow that awkwardness to move into the style itself speaks all the more for his skill. From the Inside Flap These eloquent poems of mourning and memory move deftly, as in a beautiful grave sarabande, between Spain and San Francisco, past and present, enriched by what Francisco Arag&oacute;n justly calls the "bilingual mirror" of his "coraz&oacute;n." Mono as well as bilingual readers will welcome them with admiration and pleasure. But he also acknowledges the awkwardness of the life we all lead where, for example, the body starts unexpectedly to sweat. &mdash;Thom Gunn, author of Boss Cupid . &mdash;Sandra M. Gilbert, author of Kissing the Bread Francisco Arag&oacute;n writes p<br/><br/>Stunning Little Mirrors Revealing Life's Complexities Francisco Aragon's verse has graced the pages of several chapbooks and innumerable literary journals not to mention anthologies published by W.W. Norton, Heyday Books and Soft Skull Press. Aragon is also the founding editor and publisher of Momotombo Press which promotes emerging Latino writers and is housed at the Institute for Latino Studies at the University of Notre Dame where Aragon is a Visiting Fellow. His talents at translation have been utilized for a half dozen books including those by the great Spanish poet Federico Garci. A moving album of poetic memories. If you like Cavafy, and I do, you will enjoy Aragon's poetry. These are poetic snapshots with depth. The specificity of the details (time, place, even the weather) gives the poems the authenticity of individual personal experience, but the emotional observations (love and loss, yearning and revulsion) speak to the universal human condition.</p>
