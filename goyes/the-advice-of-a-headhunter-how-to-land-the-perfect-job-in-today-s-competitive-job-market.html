During This Advice is Right On During 35 years of working in Fortune 500 consumer product companies, with responsibility growing from new hire to officer level, I directly participated in hiring decisions for more than 500 professional hires out of perhaps three times that many candidates.

This how-to book on finding a job has something for just about everybody. There are tables, figures, rules, keys, lists, a glossary and a large index that make it really easy to use. There are even sample layouts for resumes. I think that I have learned more from skimming through this book so far than in reading all of the books that my friends have on the subject. The book is brand new so the information seems to be targeted towards the job market we have today, and not 20 years ago like most of the other popular books that I've looked at.There are so many "how to get a better job" books in the field it is really hard to find<br/><br/>The Advice of a Headhunter: How to Land the Perfect Job in Today's Competitive Job Market book has been released since 2016-12-08. The Advice of a Headhunter: How to Land the Perfect Job in Today's Competitive Job Market are written by Don Hite and it has 413 of pages on paperback.</p>
