          <p class="description" itemprop="description">BAYLES has been in the software industry since 1979 in marketing and technical management consulting roles for Fortune 500 companies. . She is the Founder and CEO of BridgeCommerce, Inc., an online and off-line venture designed to assist companies with the essential backend/logistics of e-commerce. She also founded NETouch Communications, Inc., in 1994, a company that builds commerce-enabled extranets. Her first book, <i>Extranets: Building the Business-to-Business Web<br/><br/>E-Commerce Logistics and E-Fulfillment includes a complete chapter on global logistics; another on implementing back-end databases; and another on testing, implementation, and rollout. Payment processing, order fulfillment, product delivery, and other back-end logistics represent the messiest parts of e-Commerce -- but they are also the most crucial challenges in building customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. In this book, one of the world's leading e-Business logistics experts covers every element of back-end logistics, delivering unprecedented insight for decision-making -- and practical techniques that work. Learn today's best practices for order processing and customization, payment processing, handling taxation, shipping, tracking, handling customer inquiries, accounting and inventory control, as well as the unique "reverse logistics" associated with product returns. It also presents detailed, real-world case studies from the author's extensive consulting experience.. Discover world-class solutions for "end-to-end logistics": providing order visibility and service continuity from the buy button to the final destination<br/><br/>At that moment-when the visitor has just become a customer-the most crucial part of the relationship just begins. They can make or break your customer relationships, profitability, and future business. These important but unglamorous, messy, and often expensive functions are not optional in true e-business. Payment processing, order fulfillment, product delivery, and product returns handling are the largest gaps in electronic commerce today. Useful tools such as planning templates, checklists, and spreadsheets are included throughout the book and on a Web site.AudienceThis book is aimed at technically savvy executives, information technology professionals, and other enterprise leaders who are faced with the challenge of delivering the goods their organizati<br/><br/>"Excellent Guide for Ebiz & Ecommerce" according to dagmara.

A very old book (2000) with a very expensive price mat not really sure what makes this book so expensive when it was published 13 years aGo.I think it should be cheaper or at least be reviewed again since 2000 was too long ago.. Book that is long overdue A Customer This is a topic that is long overdue. One only need look at the headlines of how some e-merchants badly fouled up fulfillment this holiday and the prior one to realize how invaluable this book is for e-commerce. Especially useful are the checklists, work-sheets and the exensive research Ms. Bayles did in finding pertinent sites that have a bearing on the topic. This is a book that, in contrast to others on e-commerce, will never go out of date.</p>
