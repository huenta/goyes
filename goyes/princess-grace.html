          <p class="description" itemprop="description">Her best-known picture books are <i>Amazing Grace</i>, <i>Three Wise Women</i>, and <i>An Angel Just Like Me</i>.  Mary Hoffman has written more than 70 books for children, and her powers of observation bring vitality and humour to all her stories and retellings.Her previous titles for Dorling Kindersley include <i>Henry's Baby</i> and <i>A First Bible Story Book</i>. Mary lives in Oxfordshire with her husband and they have<br/><br/>"An uplifting and eyeopening antidote to the princess stereotype" according to Samana Siddiqui. Princesses in our culture are generally associated with vanity, superficiality and weakness. Princess Grace is an antidote to this one-sided and limiting view. Add to that the fact that this book's main character is an African-American girl named Grace and you've got a compelling s. Really a Six Star Book The front cover and back cover are different pictures of Grace as a princess. This story unfolds as she develops a reconstructed identity, a stronger one, of the various kinds of princesses - and the historical value is intact. The young reader learns about how a princess can go to. "more than one way to be pretty." according to S. Wong. I love the phrase that is oft repeated in this book, that there is more than one way to be pretty. I also love that my daughter, who is admittedly a disney-esque-princess-o-file, picked this out at the library. I have since recommended it to several teachers I know, parents of her <br/><br/>Studded with questions worth discussing, the story rolls along smoothly, illustrated with bright paintings that picture&nbsp;events and&nbsp;Grace&rsquo;s thoughts.&nbsp;Information about&nbsp;Cinderella variants, historical princesses, and Kente cloth appended. From Booklist After several chapter books, Hoffman returns to the original picture-book format for the series that started with Amazing Grace (1991). Grades K-3. On parade day, Grace and her classmates dress as royalty&nbsp;from different cultures; Grace wears West African Kente robes. Grace&rsquo;s teacher announces that two girls will ride on the school&rsquo;s float as princesses. --Carolyn Phelan . Initially excited about wearing a fairy-tale costume, Grace realizes&nbsp;that world folklore and history offer more varied and dynamic interpretations of the princess theme<br/><br/>Mary Hoffman?s picture books featuring this intrepid heroine have earned major critical acclaim; amongst other awards, <i>Amazing Grace</i> was a iReading Rainbow selection and a <i>Booklist Editors? Choice. This year two girls will be selected as princesses in the town parade, and Grace can?t wait to be one of them. From Kenya to China and from warriors to spies, princesses are a multicultural and multitalented bunch, and there are just as many kinds of happily ever afters?both for the royals and for Grace?s community and its princess parade. Grace?s latest adventure is sure to delight her established fans?and win the hearts of many more!</i>. It?s the perfect opportunity to dress up?but how, exactly, should a princess costume look? Grace asks her teacher for help, and soon the whole class is learning that there?s more to princesses than pink dresses and frills</p>
