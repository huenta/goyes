          <p class="t-side">DESCRIPTION: <p>
          <p class="description" itemprop="description">However, every glowing story of the sport's expansion has an uglier side. Brunt describes the expansion of ice hockey from the northern parts of Canada and the United States to cities that do not even have measurable snowfalls. Readers are led from day one at the draft to the Stanley Cup finals. Throughout the last two decades, the game has found its way into cities like Phoenix, Dallas, and Nashville. Florida has two hockey teams, as does California. The behind-the-scenes negotiations between players, agents, and general managers can keep players on the bench for most of the season. There is enough in this oversized book, with pictures in color and black and white, to enthrall fans, whether from Florida or Ottawa, throughout the year.<i>Susan H. From Library Journal YA-What began as a Canadian pastime in the mid-1800s has evolved into a big-money <br/><br/>. <b>Stephen Brunt</b> was born in Hamilton, Ontario, where he still lives. He is the author of<i> Mean Business</i> (1987), <i>Second To None </i>(with Roberto Alomar, 1993), and <i>Diamond Dreams</i> (1996). He is one of Canada&rsquo;s best-respected journalists, and has been a sports columnist with the <i>Globe and Mail </i>since 1989. The winner of a National Magazine Award, he brings to this book many years of covering NHL hockey on the ice and in the boardroom<br/><br/>In October 1998 an extraordinary documentary series dominated Canada&rsquo;s TV screens. Only the full co-operation of the NHL, the NHLPA, the owners, general managers, coaches, agents, and players throughout the league made this possible, taking the viewers &ndash; and now the readers &ndash; into many private meetings normally out of bounds to cameras and writers.The six episodes deal with 1) The Dance: deal-making, drafting at the summer draft pick, horse-trading between agents and managers; 2) The Show: the business of marketing hockey; 3) Showdown at Nagano; 4) The Canadian Game: by following Canadian teams we discover what hockey means to the country; 5) The Grind: the life of the players, at home and on the road; 6) Agony and Glory: the race for the Stanley Cup, and <br/><br/>Good book for avid hockey fans If you are an avid hockey fan, you will probably find this of interest. If you're just an average fan who only cares about on ice action, it may not be all that enjoyable. The book is based on a CBC-TV series and the producers were given behind the scenes access into events not normally open to the media during the 1997-1998. StrippedAGear said Disappointing.. I didn't get much out of the book. If you want good reading on a year's worth of NHL activities, check out Roy McGregor's 'Road Games,' or Gzowski's 'Game of our Lives.' I wasn't very satisfied with this purchase.. "Fascinating Reading" according to A Customer. Great book for those curious about what happens in the NHL. Enjoyable, but drags at times. Just read through it, because it's worth every word in gold.</p>
